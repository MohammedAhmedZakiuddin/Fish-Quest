# FishQuest

• Designed and implemented an intuitive map interface that allows users to search for their desired fish species and find
recommended locations to catch them; increased user engagement by 50%. <br/>
• Developed a dynamic social feed feature allowing users to upload and share their catches, interact with fellow anglers
through likes and comments, and fostered a 20% increase in user engagement, contributing to a vibrant and active
angling community. <br/>
• Utilized machine learning models and LIDAR sensors to help users identify the species of fish they catch, as well as
estimate the fish’s size and weight, resulting in a 15% increase in accuracy. <br/>
